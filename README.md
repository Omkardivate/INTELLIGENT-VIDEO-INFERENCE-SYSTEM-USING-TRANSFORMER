# INTELLIGENT-VIDEO-INFERENCE-SYSTEM-USING-TRANSFORMER
An intelligent video inference system is a computer vision technology that is designed to automatically analyze video data and extract useful information. This system can be used to convert video to frames and then analyze those frames using advanced deep learning techniques such as transformer-based image captioning for detecting and describing the events in a video.
